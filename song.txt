I'll wait until you have to go,
I'll make it so you never ever know
How much I have messed it up!
We're running 'round like we don't care,
It's gonna leave its marks somewhere,
Do you want to show me something new?

(You go now, reached my top anyway
You go now, reached my top anyway)
Just tell me what I have to do,
To keep myself apart from you
All your colors start to burn
I know I wanted far too much,
Then I thought that wouldn't be enough
All this talk is closing you.

Take shelter,
Take the pressure,
Do what you want tonight, it's alright,
If you want to get used,
You get used!
Take shelter,
Take the pressure,

Do what you want tonight, it's alright,
If you want to get used,
Then get used!
I don't really wanna stop myself
Nobody's gonna tell me I need help,
